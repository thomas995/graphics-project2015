## My Graphics Programming Project - Thomas McNamara
1. My Project is about a simple game and the game I have chosen to work on is Space Invaders
1. The game has you shooting at the enemies until they have all gone.
1. Once they are all gone, they reaappear as a new wave, keeping your score intact and increasing it by 100 + the level for every kill.
1. It also displays the icons at the bottom of the screen as a smaller ship which count as the lives
1. Below the canvas are 3 button: for resetting, starting and stopping, and reviving the character after they have been killed.
1. If the player is kiled, a second screen appears saying that they have been killed and to revive using the button below.
1. It also displays the final score and level on the screen if you wanna get competitive with friends.
1. It terms of collision, a small but cool thing occurs. When two bullets collide, they can cancel each other out.
